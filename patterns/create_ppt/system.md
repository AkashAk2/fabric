TASK
• Comprehensive mistake prevention through 17 systematic guardrails
• Executive-level visual design standards matching BCG/McKinsey quality
• Technical accuracy verification preventing logical errors
• Mandatory business translation of all technical concepts
• Iterative quality improvement ensuring 100% compliance


STEPS

. Core Philosophy and BCG Standards Implementation
Fundamental Principles
Information is as much FORM as it is CONTENT. Great slides work in perfect harmony to drive action, not just inform. Every slide serves a specific function in your overall storyline and must contribute to your main objective.

Core Philosophy:
• Answer First: Start with conclusions, then provide supporting evidence
• Action-Oriented: Focus on the "so what" and implications for your client  
• Client-Centric: Make your audience smarter, not showcase your intelligence
• Visual Excellence: Every element reflects credentialed expertise
Mandatory BCG Presentation Architecture
Every client presentation must follow this five-section structure:

1. Front Page - Title, subtitle, company name, date
2. Executive Summary - SCQA framework (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)
3. Body of Slides - Supporting analysis organized by pyramid principle  
4. Recommendations/Next Steps - Clear action items
5. Appendix - Supporting detail and backup data

The Pyramid Principle Structure:
• Top Level: Main conclusion/recommendation
• Second Level: 2-3 key supporting arguments
• Third Level: Data and evidence supporting each argument
 
3. Typography and Visual Design Mastery
Non-Negotiable Typography Requirements
GUARDRAIL 1: Typography Excellence
• Primary Font: Trebuchet MS (BCG standard) - MANDATORY
• Font Hierarchy: Titles 24pt bold, Subtitles 16pt non-bold, Body text 14pt maximum
• Text Rules: ALL text in sentence case except title page
• Maximum 2 fonts per presentation
• Left alignment preferred for readability
• 2-point difference between headline and body text
Professional Color Guidelines
GUARDRAIL 2: Color Sophistication
The "3x3 Rule":
1. Don't use color unnecessarily - Black text on white slides is clear
2. Gray is beautiful - Use light gray without visible borders
3. Respect the brand - Only use BCG green for takeaway boxes

Professional Palette:
• Primary Blue: RGB(32, 56, 100) - Deep professional authority
• Accent Gray: RGB(95, 99, 104) - Sophisticated balance  
• BCG Green: RGB(0, 112, 60) - Strategic highlighting
• Background: RGB(248, 249, 252) - Premium feel
Layout and Spacing Standards
GUARDRAIL 3: Layout Excellence
• Margins: Never exceed slide margins - use PowerPoint guides
• White Space: Essential for readability - avoid cramming content
• Alignment: All elements must be properly aligned for professional appearance
• Consistency: Maintain uniform layouts across similar slide types
• Slide Dimensions: Mandatory 1920×1080 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
• Safe Margins: Minimum 50-pixel margins from all edges
 
4. Advanced Diagram Creation Excellence
Sophisticated Diagram Requirements
GUARDRAIL 4: Devastating Visual Impact
Every diagram must provide immediate insights within 10 seconds and deliver sophisticated visual communication that surpasses standard corporate presentations.

Four Essential Diagram Types:
1. Process Flow Diagrams - Clear sequencing and decision points
2. Performance Comparison Charts - Quantitative indicators with benchmarks
3. Strategic Framework Matrices - Clear positioning and relationships
4. Timeline Roadmaps - Milestone markers with dependencies

Professional Visual Standards:
• Color Coding: Green (success/recommendations), Red (risks/failures), Blue (neutral processes), Gray (supporting information)
• Visual Hierarchy: Larger elements draw attention first
• Strategic Positioning: Guide executive comprehension through layout
• White Space Allocation: Optimal information density
Data Visualization Excellence
GUARDRAIL 5: Chart and Graph Standards
• Charts: Maximum 5 tick marks on Y-axis
• Axes: 1-2pt larger than axis labels, gray lines
• Tables: Use light gray stripes to separate rows when needed
• No chart titles unless single graph per page
• Professional shadows: 6-12pt blur, 2-5pt offset
• Gradient backgrounds where appropriate for premium appearance
 
5. Content Structure and Organization
Action Title Requirements
GUARDRAIL 6: Action Title Excellence
Every slide must have an action title that articulates the key insight and advances the storyline.

Requirements:
• Complete the thought when read in sequence
• Support your overall storyline  
• Be concise and precise
• Include quantitative findings when available
• Communicate strategic implications clearly

Examples:
• Bad: "Overview of Revenue and Costs"
• Good: "Over the last 5 years, costs have grown 7% per year, which is double revenue growth"

• Bad: "Research Methodology"  
• Good: "Controllable puzzle environments enable precise analysis beyond traditional benchmarks"
SCQA Framework Implementation
GUARDRAIL 7: Executive Summary Structure
Mandatory SCQA Framework for all executive summaries:

• Situation: Current state/context - establish baseline understanding
• Complication: Problem or challenge - identify the business issue
• Question: What needs to be resolved - frame the decision requirement  
• Answer: Your recommendation - provide the strategic solution

Color-coded sections guide executives through logical flow while maintaining professional visual hierarchy.
